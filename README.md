# FastStore 
## An open ecommerce framework

FastStore is an open ecommerce framework built using modern technologies that aims to deliver the building blocks necessary for creating your custom ecommerce experience. With these building blocks you can achieve:

- Multiregion stores with native internationalization support
- Great Performance (90+ on Google's page speed insights)
- SEO ready pages with Google's Rich Results support
- CMS managed content
- Jamstack based (deploy with Netlify, Vercel and any other JAMStack platform)
- Marketplace ready with support to millions of skus
- Intelligence via Google Analytics and GTM
- Evergreen stores with our no-fork based approach

## Why building FastStore?
The web is a wild and noisy environment. Many projects claim to solve many different aspects of web development but none of them solves the ecommerce problem satisfactorily. Ecommerce is a very complex case where performance is a must, but personalization is the key. 

After years of developing ecommerces, FastStore creators packaged all of this knowledge into easy, ready to use building blocks for crafting production-ready, multi-region marketplaces.

FastStore not only contains code, but knowledge and guidelines to change the way you think and build ecommerces

## Project philosophy
This project has a very well defined list of priorities. When solving an issue, a lower-ranking priority must not degrade or override an upper ranking priority.
The priorities are all about the stores' user experience and retailer satisfaction about it. For us that means:

1. Performance - Great score on Lighthouse and Core Web Vitals
2. Stability - E2E tests are complete and make sure the critical paths are covered
3. No fork - Features should be delivered by dependencies and not by a store fork
4. Feature completion - Enable you to craft your custom ecommerce experience

## Why Jamstack and Gatsby?
Jamstack focuses on performance and stability, which is part of our core philosophy.

Gatsby has a philosophy where customization can shadow the default theme implementation. This means we are able to deliver new performance improvements and bug fixes only by upgrading a dependency in your project. Also, Gatsby is very aligned with our performance concerns by implementing the PRPL architecture.

## Continuous Performance and Stability
Maintaining the FastStore performance and stability is a key element. For this, using Lighthouse CI and Cypress in your CI/CD pipeline is **highly** recommended. 

We provide a base setup for both platforms so you can easily add them to your CI/CD platform.

## Docs
FastStore docs are under development. For now, the available docs are:

- **Architecture**: learn more about this project's architecture
- **Component**: learn how to develop a reusable component

## Contributing
This is still a work in progress, however, if you are also an adventurous person, you can read the code and have some fun!

### How to develop
`graphql-js` package is cumbersome when using `yarn link` because it requires only one instance of the package and there are two.

To solve this problem you can deduplicate the instances by going into this project's `node_modules` and changing the file `node_modules/graphql/index.js` to:

```js
module.exports = require('<path/to/the/tenant.store/node_modules/graphql/index.js>')
```
